> _Provide a link to documentation for a technical/developer-focused product, which you think are well done, and explain why you think they are well done._

This might be an off-the-wall choice, but I really like [the technical docs and build instructions for the **nyblcore** tiny synthesizer](https://schollz.com/wares/nyblcore/). All of the information necessary exists on a single page, which contains: 
- a demo video
- the ability to get one yourself 
- audio samples of the device
- build tutorial video 
- [printable 'zine' documentation](https://nyblcore.com/guide)
- link to the source code for the instrument
- a small amount of philosophizing
- link to the compiled stock firmware, ready to install
- an application for creating custom firmware
- an alternate firmware with use instructions
- firmware installation tutorial (with images and screenshots!)
- the ability to reach out directly if more is needed

This page of documentation and instructions is a prime example of knowing the audience of users very well. Someone who will buy and build their own synthesizer device will want to know what it can do, how it will sound, and how to build, use, and modify the device. Since it's all focused on a single piece of hardware, it's useful to have all of the necessary information and instructions in a single place. There are a few videos that give information that would be complicated or difficult to understand written without the context of the actual sounds coming out of the device. The printable zine documentation is, I think, brilliant because it understands the punk/diy audience of people who build small synthesizers, is easily readable when printed from even a bad printer, and is far more effective as a single printed page that can be folded and packed away with a device, then referenced at a moment's notice. Having every resource needed to reset/modify/replace the firmware on the single page is a way for the maker to encourage this kind of experimentation without making things seem too complicated.
